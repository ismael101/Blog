    content: "Ecobank announced record profits when it released its results in March this year. This is a remarkable turnaround for an institution that had taken impairment charges of $864m in 2016. Insiders attribute this largely to the sterling leadership of Group CEO, Ade Ayeyemi.\n\nAyeyemi, regarded in the industry as a pure banker due to his affection for facts, figures and other statistics, is also a stickler for fine detail.\n\nThe way he approached this interview reveals his Cartesian thinking, He dissects a problem like a surgeon and qualifies his answers with a rational explanation, often within an economic context. He shows cause and effect, how outcomes can be affected by which lever you choose to pull.\n\nAyeyemi joined the bank four years ago, at a time when it had gone through turmoil due to internal leadership issues with the acrimonious departure of a former CEO, Thierry Tanoh.\n\nTaking over from Albert Essien – a veteran at the bank who had been promoted to steady the ship – in 2015 Ayeyemi also had to navigate a downturn in Africa’s economic fortunes.\n\nTwo of Africa’s largest economies, Nigeria and South Africa, had both entered their first recessions in two decades.\n\nIn 2016 the bank, after the impairment charges, posted a loss. The charges related to bad legacy loans incurred as a result of poor management in some subsidiaries. Ayeyemi quickly but quietly replaced those culpable.\n\nHe managed to restore the bank to profitability the following year and set challenging targets – increasing profitability and also, introducing a breathtakingly ambitious digital roll-out aimed at nothing less than a goal of securing 100m digital clients by 2020. 20m clients have signed up so far, but the momentum should bring many others quickly.",

    content: "MOGADISHU (HOL) - Former Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn has denied he was aware of secret torture prisons in the country noting he could not change some human rights violations since he was an outsider in a ‘deep system’.\nIn a hard-hitting interview with the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, Desalegn said he tried to initiate reform to pave way for the current Premier Abiy Ahmed but noted the entrenched political system was largely sanctioned by the ruling party.\n\n“It is a deep system which I was not able to look into because of my background and because I was an outsider coming into a deep system so I couldn’t see that,” said Desalegn responding to claims of failure to deter human rights violations and torture by security organs.\n\nDesalegn said his resignation was a means of taking responsibility for what he could not change noting even though he may have disagreed with the party, he could not ‘utter a word’.\n\n“I resigned to take all the responsibilities,” said Desalegn. “You know when there is a communist mentality, when there’s a Marxist mentality, there’s centralism where you don’t utter a word after the party decides on an issue, even though you have differences as a minority.”",

    category: "business",
    content: "The demand for certain natural resources found in Africa play a key role in electric products. For example, lithium is a much sought after commodity found in many parts of southern Africa’s Zimbabwe.\n\nA jump in global demand for electric cars and batteries has driven demand for mined minerals such as lithium, graphite, cobalt and copper, a key compenent in electric car batteries.\n\n“We see investment opportunities across Africa in mining, oil and gas, green energy as well as real estate. We are currently doing a deal in the lithium space. Lithium is what you need for batteries and electric cars,” says Per Wimmer, a former Goldman Sachs banker and the founder of Wimmer Financial LLP, a London-based corporate advisory firm.\n\nAs the demand for electric cars and batteries increases, so does demand for what goes into a battery, which is lithium, graphite, cobalt and copper, Wimmer explains. These elements are vital for new technology advancements and products, and are therefore shaping demand and supply on a global scale.\n\n“As a result of that we are currently doing a $200 million deal with a lithium mine in Africa, so it very much plays into that theme for near-term production. This plant is in Zimbabwe,” says Wimmer.\n\nKibo Energy, a company focusing on the development of thermal coal power projects in Tanzania, Botswana and Mozambique, recently received formal notice from Tanesco inviting it to develop the Mbeya Coal to Power Project for the export market.\n\nKibo also recently appointed Wimmer Financial LLP to manage the structuring and provision of a project finance corporate credit line facility of up to $900 million, which will help to secure debt requirements for its African energy projects.",

    category: "business",
    content: "After weeks of peaceful sit-ins outside the military headquarters in Khartoum, the uneasy truce between Sudan’s security forces and thousands of protestors demanding change was finally ruptured at dawn on 3 June. Members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – a militia widely condemned for human rights violations in its suppression of rebels in the western province of Darfur – fanned out across the city and proceeded to kill over 100 demonstrators.\n\nA grim warning had been given just days before by Mohamed “Hemedti” Hamdan Dagolo, the leader of the RSF and vice-president of the Transitional Military Council (TMC), the body that has controlled the country since the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir in April. “My patience has limits,” he said.\n\nHemedti, along with the head of the army, Abdul Fattah al-Burhan, has emerged as a key figure within the TMC. With a violent past and control of a paramilitary force estimated to number as many as 40,000, many fear that he has set his ambitions on more than simply preventing Sudan’s transition to democracy.\n\nHis reported vast personal wealth – accrued from the gold trade, along with outsourcing his militia to the former regime and Saudi Arabia to fight the war in Yemen – under­pins his power.\n\nIn 2017, Sudan produced 107 tonnes of gold, making it the third-largest producer on the continent after Ghana and South Africa. Some 70% of output is estimated to be smuggled abroad, although the true size of the illicit trade is hard to quantify. Through his militia, Hemedti controls one of the country’s most lucrative gold mines – Jebel Amer in North Darfur.",

    category: "business",
    content: "This week the company announced the formation of a consortium of contractors so it can begin some of the work even before it makes a final decision on going forward. \n\nThe $33 billion enlargement of Mozambique’s Rovuma LNG complex will transform the country’s $15 billion economy, create thousands of jobs, give government more money to work with, and raise people’s standard of living.\n\nIf these reserves are exploited effectively, experts predict that Mozambique could become the world’s third largest LNG exporter, increasing Africa’s roughly 8 percent share of global gas exports.        \n\nAt the same time, it will position Mozambique as a key supplier to African countries wishing to use gas to stabilize their unreliable electrical power grids — a continent-wide problem that has hurt African economic growth for decades.\n\nA giant is born\nThe stage was set for Exxon Mobil transforming Rovuma into a giant when it acquired a sizeable stake in the project from Eni in 2017. The deal specified that the Italian company would concentrate on getting the gas out of the ground while Exxon Mobil would focus on the gas-liquefaction part of the venture. \n\nThe United States is liquefying shale gas for export. Qatar and Australia are big LNG suppliers. Even Russia, which has relied for decades on pipelines to transport gas to Europe, Turkey, China and elsewhere, is making an LNG push.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa’s longtime oil and gas leader, has long dominated the continent’s relatively small LNG sector. But other African countries are jumping in.\n\nBesides exporting LNG to non-African countries, Equatorial Guinea has negotiated an LNG sales deal with Ghana and a transport infrastructure agreement with Burkina Faso.\n\nEnergy experts worry that a recent surge in gas discoveries around the world will lead to a glut of the resource, depressing the industry for years.\n\nBut the pundits are often wrong. In my experience as a petroleum-industry deal maker in Africa, while supply can outstrip demand at times, demand always catches up.",

After successfully making peace with Eritrea, the prime minister mediated disputes between Eritrea and Djibouti, resolving their disagreements. The premier also played a role in making peace in Sudan and South Sudan. \nBy drawing on the resources of the region, the new policy aims to create new alliances and opportunities to end the massive waste of human potential in the region, according to the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",

This call was echoed by the two main sponsors of the awards, the African Guarantee Fund and the Bank of Industry, both of whom have created a number of innovative instruments and mechanisms to lend to the SME sector. \n\nThe two big awards of the night went to development finance institutions. Afreximbank won Bank of the Year and the Trade and Development Bank’s President, Ethiopian Admassu Tadesse, won African Banker of the Year. TDB has grown its portfolio five-fold since Tadesse took over as President, largely increasing its presence in East and Southern Africa, where it operates.
